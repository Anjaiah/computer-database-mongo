This is a classic CRUD application, backed by MongoDB. It demonstrates:

- Accessing a MongoDB database using Casbah and Salat
- Achieving, table pagination and CRUD forms.
- Integrating with a CSS framework (Twitter Bootstrap ).


This is basically a port of the sample application in Play-2 in order to demonstrate mongodb and salat

In order to set up the mongodb database please run the following commands

mongoimport -d computer-database -c companies --file data/companies.json
mongoimport -d computer-database -c computers --file data/computers.json

Due to a bug in mongoimport the 'old' computers with dates before 1970 are in a separate data file data/computers_old.json
