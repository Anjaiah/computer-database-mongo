This is a classic CRUD application, backed by MongoDB. It demonstrates:

- Accessing a MongoDB database using Casbah and Salat
- Achieving, table pagination and CRUD forms.
- Integrating with a CSS framework (Twitter Bootstrap ).


This is basically a port of the sample application in Play-2 in order to demonstrate mongodb and salat. I have made as little changes in controller/view layer as possible.

When the application is first started test data is sourced into the mongo database specified in the 'mongo.url' configuration.
